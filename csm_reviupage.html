                    <p id="desc1">So, why do I make this page when there are many websites with the same information that I have told above? Yes, it's because I really like this manga and I want to tell everyone why you should read Chainsaw Man. Let's check it out!</p>
                        <h3>The Story</h3>
                            <p>The story is very simple. It's about a poor boy in the Devil world where he died and was revived and got a new power. But that's not it. In exchange for this power, our main character (Denji) has to work as a Public Safety Devil Hunter. And as the story goes far, many characters will die, the enemy & the devils become more and more powerful, and Denji's life turns upside down. After re-reading this manga, I realize that this title doesn't have a filler chapter like a long-running manga. It's a very straightforward read, one character shows up and dies. But, the main purpose of this dead character is so the story will go with progress. Chainsaw Man offers you a funny moment, a what-the-f-is-going-on moment, a badass moment, a wow moment, and a sad moment.</p>
                            <h3>The Art</h3>
                            <p>Yes. Visually appealing. Even though it's in black and white, you can't help but captivate by the dynamic action this manga has. Not only for the action, but some of the panels would be great as a meme. Fujimoto Sensei also likes to make the SFX connected with the panel and it's very aesthetic. The character's facial expression is also great. The villain design is very intriguing. And many page spread of the manga that was too good only to be seen in a second. Some of this art can be described like this:</p>

                            <p id="desc3">Is Denji a shonen-troupe main character? Well yes and no. Yes because he has a dream, he is willing to fulfill his dream, and he has more emotions as the story goes on. No, because he is a simp, unintelligent, and very true to his desire. Can we relate to him? It depends. But I think his goofy personality comes from his uneducated self and the miserable life he had in the past. Characters like Makima, Aki, and Power become a key to Denji's development, and also the villains, the Public Safety Division, the evil mastermind that I don't mention here make the story develop.</p>
